`drawframe' allows you to draw a frame on the screen.  This frame will always appears on the top of all windows.  Il is useful if you want to record the desktop for a screencast, for example.


## Compilation and execution

drive, give it the execute permission and execute it:

```
chmod u+x drawframe
./drawframe 720p
```

For help, use:

If you want to compile from source, use the `Makefile` and juste run `make`.  You will need the X11 and Xext libraries (you can install them with the packages `libx11-dev` and `libxext-dev` on Ubuntu).
